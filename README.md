# Aleo Explorer (?)

## Description

Maybe one day this could become an explorer for Aleo. (But I can't really design UI so that day is far away)

For now this is just a (fake) node that connects to any Aleo node and fetches the blockchain data. The node is NOT validating blocks. Only connect to nodes that you trust.

The code smells rusty as I'm recreating all types from Rust code.

*Maybe I should separate the node part as it's complicated enough*
